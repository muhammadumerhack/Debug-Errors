Fix Error---
Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind hint: its remote counterpart.

Solution:-
git pull -r origin master
git push -u origin master

Basically it happens when our git branches refs are not rebased and so pull -r rebases our branches to one we are trying to set.
